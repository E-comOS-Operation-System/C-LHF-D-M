C-LHF&D-M Package Manager Exceptions

Based on Section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3
Terms and Conditions

As the copyright holder of the C-LHF&D-M package manager, principal developer and project initiator Saladin5101, in accordance with Section 7 of AGPLv3, hereby grants the following additional permissions:

1. Client Tool Exception
Notwithstanding Section 13 of AGPLv3 regarding network services, it is hereby clarified that using C-LHF&D-M as a command-line tool or local application does not constitute "interaction with a user over a network" and therefore does not trigger the Network Services clause of AGPLv3.

2. Package Management Operation Exception
Packages installed, managed, cached, and distributed through C-LHF&D-M are permitted to maintain their original license status.

The AGPLv3 license of C-LHF&D-M does not affect the licenses of managed packages through package management operations.

3. Build Tool Integration Exception
C-LHF&D-M may be used as a component of build toolchains, including integration with proprietary build systems, CI/CD pipelines, and development environments, provided that such integration does not involve modifying the source code of C-LHF&D-M itself.

4. Explicit License for Commercial Use
C-LHF&D-M is explicitly permitted for use in enterprise environments, proprietary software development processes, and commercial products to manage dependencies, without requiring software projects using C-LHF&D-M to open-source their code.

5. Legal Effect
This exception is granted pursuant to Section 7 of AGPLv3. If any part of this exception is held invalid, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of AGPLv3.
