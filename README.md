The C Language Header Files and Dependency Manager is a dependency and package manager for the C language. Here, we refer to all packages as "dependencies" (of course, you can call them "packages" if you prefer).
## How to use
This package manager is generally used in conjunction with a compiler (especially a C compiler, otherwise what would be the point of having it?). This article will tell you how to use C-LHF&D-M.<br>
  >On a moonless afternoon, you happily open your MacBook Air, equipped with an M4 chip. You open ECLC (a compiler you might not have heard of, but don't worry about it, I wrote it) for a couple of minutes. Suddenly, you want to write a few lines of C code for Windows™, but macOS clearly lacks the C libraries and header files for Windows. What do you do?

  Try putting yourself in this scenario. Then you'll realize how incredibly important a package manager like Cargo is for a cross-platform developer—because this is based on my own experience.<br>
  So, to solve this thorny problem, I developed... this package manager for C. It's different from a system-level package manager that can install a package to the system directory. I wouldn't dare; I'd just end up crashing the system and then be blaming myself for the rest of the afternoon.<br>
